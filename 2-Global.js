// In Node.js, the term "globals" usually refers to built-in global objects or variables that are available in any module without requiring an explicit import statement. Some of the commonly used global objects in Node.js include:

// console: The console object provides methods for logging messages to the console, such as console.log(), console.warn(), and console.error().

// process: The process object provides information about the Node.js process, such as environment variables, command-line arguments, and the current working directory.

// Buffer: The Buffer object provides a way to work with binary data in Node.js.

// setTimeout, setInterval, clearTimeout, clearInterval: These are functions used to schedule asynchronous operations.

// __dirname and __filename: These variables provide the full path of the current directory and file, respectively.


console.log(__dirname);

console.log(__filename);
